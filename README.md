This project was built using Ruby on Rails for the backend (located here at [ConnossieurBackend](https://github.com/jtx007/ConnosieurBackend)). The frontend was built with Javascript and React.js and the CSS used is from an external library called Materialize CSS, loosely based on Google's Material UI.

This application was built with sneaker enthusiasts in mind.  It's platform for individuals to find their favorite sneakers and show them off on their individual profiles.  They can also go to the thread page and discuss all things sneaker and engage in riveting conversations. 

I have a standard login and registration page that utilizes bcrypt and the Ruby gem knock for the backend
The pivotal piece of this project is the database of sneakers.  This data was scraped from a website called [StockX](https://stockx.com/) which is a popular and well known sneaker consignment platform.

## The sneaker database

Here users can add their favorite sneakers to their "OWN" or "WANTS" lists.  The user then can engage in discussions with other users about sneakers or any other related topics by clicking on the threads button in the navbar or after creating a new post via their profile page.

# Connosieur

This application was built with sneaker enthusiasts in mind.  It's platform for individuals to find their favorite sneakers and show them off on their individual profiles.  They can also go to the thread page and discuss all things sneaker and engage in conversations with other users and see their sneakers.

## Please check out this [video demo](https://youtu.be/PVA6Xyg6c74) to see it in action



I have a standard login and authentication is handled with [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) and the gem [knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock) for the backend.

The pivotal piece of this project is the database of sneakers.  This data was scraped from a website called [StockX](https://stockx.com/), a well known sneaker consignment platform.

## The sneaker database

Here users can add their favorite sneakers to their "OWN" or "WANTS" lists.  The user then can engage in discussions with other users about sneakers or any other related topics by clicking on the threads button in the navbar or after creating a new post via their profile page.
